<h3>What's the Process?</h3>
<div id="process-line">
<ul>
<li id="process"><b id="how-1"></b><p>We research various localities and update our database with the most crucial needs they are deprived of</p></li>
<li id="process"><b id="how-2"></b><p>When you log into your account, you may build connections and campaign about a locality to your connections</p></li>
<li id="process"><b id="how-3"></b><p>You may also contribute a relief. We accept only one item per locality. You can still contribute to multiple localities or add a mass contribution request</p></li>
<li id="process"><b id="how-4"></b><p>After a locality gets necessary level of support, we move to pickup items. We send a special gift to the supporters to celebrate these invisible connections</p></li>
