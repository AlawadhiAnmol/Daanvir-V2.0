Hi ,

You have been Shortlisted for the 2nd round. A task has been assigned to you.

We are gonna do what is done before designing a webpage.

Design a blue print of what  you are gonna make (either pen-paper or Photoshop).

1. A Web Page for Team mates showing their contribution towards this project (6 7 members)

which will include their instagram,facebook and Linkedin accounts) .

2. A gallery based webpage where there will be pictures in an interactive way.



All the designs should be attractive,catchy and should not look childish.
