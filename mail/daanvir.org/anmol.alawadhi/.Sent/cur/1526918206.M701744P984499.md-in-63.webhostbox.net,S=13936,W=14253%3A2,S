The topic of my writing is drawing and color books are important for 
orphanage children.

Colors are way of expression.

Color is the power that directly influence the soul.

Colors like features follow the change of emotions.

Orphans are not alone or drained they actually are one of the brightest 
creation of color.

Orphans need color books and drawings in order to express their emotions and 
their feelings.

Not only the expression but also for knowledge they need colors as they 
teaches us many life lessons and anout nature.

Drawing is a way to channelize the thoughts into paper that makes an orphan 
confident and also motivated for persuing a good future.

Instead of being in vain and agony they would be able to recognize the 
potential they have.colors and drawing is the art of understanding oneself 
and conveying their thoughts.

Thankyou for the opportunity

As the internship is about blogs and how to make them good and relevent  to 
read .

The basic idea is about different fields :

1.emotional / life lessons

Its a matter of reaching readers heart by analysing his/her situation .it 
can be analysed by writing some solutions to problem or the way they think 
about their way of living what they want or what they have.

The reader will only read the blog if he/she can relate and the solutions of 
issues like trust work family self confidence knowledge etc.

2.real life incidents

Its a topic about which every one is interested to read because they want 
knowlege or for their own leasures.

3.political/governmental facts

Its a topic which which people prefer less unless they have interest in 
current affairs and politics but their are people who want to know how to 
tackle in political issues emotionally and mentally so blogs are way of 
finding solutions and relaxing their minds.
