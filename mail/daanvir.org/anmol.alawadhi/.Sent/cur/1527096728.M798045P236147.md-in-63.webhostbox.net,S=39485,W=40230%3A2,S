                         Drawing and color book importance to orphanage 
children

Orphanage, it’s like a second home for the homeless Childs. The literal 
meaning of orphanage, it is a residential institution for the care and 
education of orphans. The orphans are those who don’t have a family, the 
people residing in the orphanage were considered it as a big family which 
helps in the Child’s development and growth. The children living in the 
orphanage are the important part of the society and they have a greater role 
to play in the developing process of the nation. Today’s child is tomorrow’s 
future of the nation. Life in an orphanage is a life of change, caregivers 
come and go. The Childs living in the street and in the orphanage doesn’t 
get chance to lead a comfortable life like a child who lived with his 
family. The life of Childs living in orphanage lead a life on the basis of a 
particular schedule, children get up, get cleaned, eat, learn, and 
regimented way. There is serious lacking of creativity in their lives. If 
you closely analyses their life style then you can realize more or less they 
are leading a life of robot that function on the basis of certain fixed 
programs. These children also have full right to lead a normal life like 
other children. But due to large in number and presence of fewer caretakers 
they are enabling to lead a fairytale life like others.

India is one of the most populous country where every day almost 34 Childs 
born and among them a large number of child are orphan. According to a study 
conducted by the Hindustan times there are 20million children those who are 
orphan, it occupy almost 4% of the total population of the nation. Not every 
child gets a chance to live with a family. Many more have to stay in an 
orphanage. Due to the large amount of number every child rising in the 
orphanage doesn’t get a chance to lead a happy life. More or less they are 
happy that they are getting chance to have food and have a place to sleep. 
But is this their destiny. No, this is not. We should take necessary steps 
to make their lives happier and interesting. Drawing and painting is a very 
nice way to develop the creativity and is better option to express 
ourselves. Children’s have an emotional attachment to painting and drawing. 
Even though painting is not every child’s cup of tea but every child should 
get a chance to draw and paint. Painting can help the child to communicate 
their emotions without the use of any words. It also allows children an 
educational opportunity which is very exciting, it helps in developing 
various types of skills among them; it is a great field to develop their 
creativity. Painting can play the role of therapy for a child who might be 
feeling different emotions; whether these feelings are subtle or extreme in 
nature. In addition to communication, painting can help children feel better 
about things that may have bottled up inside. It is a better way for 
expressing the innovative ideas.

Children are the backbone of a nation and development of any nation depends 
on the health and well-being of its child population. India has the second 
largest child populations in the World. Child development encompasses the 
ways in which children acquire skills in a range of domains, including 
memory, cognition and language, gross and finer motor ability, social 
interaction and behavior. The first few years of life, especially infancy is 
a dynamic phase of life and is characterized by rapid growth and 
development. When children do not get the right start, they never catch up 
or reach their full potentials. Children are the essential part of the 
nation and they should be treated with much care, love and affection so that 
they can prosper to the fullest. People of the society should come forward 
to help these children by donating more and more product so that get full 
access to grow as well as to develop. These children are the future our 
nation and it’s on us how we are constructing our future. If we nurture them 
we love and provide them with books, color books and dresses then only these 
children get ample chance to grow individually.
